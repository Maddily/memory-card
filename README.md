# Ghibli Cards

This is a memory card game built with React and Vite. The game contains 16 cards, a Studio Ghibli character for each card. It keeps track of a player's current score and their highscore. The main goal behind building this game was to practice React concepts, like state management, effects and creating reusable components.
